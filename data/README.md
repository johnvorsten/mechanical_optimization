# Description of data files

The file dummy_data.csv contains dummy condenser water temperature, power input, and cooling output for (3) variable speed chillers loosely based on a Trane model CGCL 200 with made-up performance characteristics. The data is anchored at 100% of rated load, which is 49.2 [kW] of cooling capacity at 21.9 [kW] power input, resulting in 2.246 [kW/kW] coefficient of performance at rated load. Minimum load is anchored at 20% of rated load, with 9.84 [kW] cooling capacity at 6.84 [kW] power input resulting in 1.43 [kW/kW] coefficient of performance at minimum load. Maximum efficiency varies with condenser water inlet temperature, but is centered around 34.4 [kW] cooling capacity (70% of rated load) at 9.37 [kW] power input resulting in 3.67 [kW] coefficient of performance at maximum efficiency.
