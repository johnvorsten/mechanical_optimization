## Chiller efficiency inputs
Chiller efficiency depends on only 4 inputs:
* Water to refrigerant heat transfer
* Refrigerant cycle thermodynamics
* Power conversion and transmission efficiency
* Centrifugal compressor efficiency

These are broad categories, and most of each category cannot be changed once a piece of equipment is purchased. For example, power conversion efficiency and compressor efficiency cannot be improved once a chiller is bought. There are few things that an owner can change about how they operate equipment once it is purchased, and this blog will describe the owners strategies for optimally operating chillers.

## How can someone improve water to refrigerant heat transfer?
* Condenser water temperature
